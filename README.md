# Sixers-Statistics-With-Linked-Lists

This was a project in my CS265 (Advanced Programming Techniques) course.

The program reads in a csv file containing all of the current and past sixers players, their salary, and years played for the team. The rows for each player might not be in order if they left the team and then came back. The information is added to a player struct and inserted into a linked list. The list is sorted alphabetically so the player rows are grouped together. This makes it easy to loop through the linked list and find statistics like the player who played the most seasons for the team, the player who earned the most total money from the team, and the player who had the highest salary for one year. This information is found and printed to the console.
